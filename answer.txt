3. Create ‘branch1' branch from ‘dev’ branch, create one file in ‘branch1’, as well create ‘branch2’ branch and  add one file for this branch too.

step 1.Ran "git Branch" command 
step 2.Checkout to branch "dev"
step 3.created a branch "branch1" in dev branch using "git branch branch1" command
step 4.Created a file "branch1file.txt" in branch1
step 5.Checkout to dev branch
step 6.created a branch "branch2" in dev branch using "git branch branch2" command
step 7.Created a file "branch2file.txt" in branch2


4. Change some contents in existing file inside ‘branch1’ branch, and do same thing for ‘branch2’


step 1.Ran "git Branch" command

step 3.Merged branch1 and branch2 using "git merge branch1 brnch2 command"


8. Follow the steps:


(a). Make a few changes in ‘branch1’ contents

step 1.Ran "git Branch" command
step 2.Checkout to branch "branch1"
step 3.Added few lines in branch1file.txt




(b). Without ‘adding and committing those changes’ (branch1), make some changes in branch2 contents (stash your branch1 changes and then apply some changes in branch2)

9. Follow the steps:


    (a). Create two branches from dev, i.e ‘feature1’ & ‘feature2’.

ashwani@ashwani-HP-Notebook-PC:~/Desktop/labexercise/exercise$ git branch
  branch1
  branch2
* dev
  master
ashwani@ashwani-HP-Notebook-PC:~/Desktop/labexercise/exercise$ git branch feature1
ashwani@ashwani-HP-Notebook-PC:~/Desktop/labexercise/exercise$ git branch feature2
ashwani@ashwani-HP-Notebook-PC:~/Desktop/labexercise/exercise$ git branch
  branch1
  branch2
* dev
  feature1
  feature2
  master



    (b). Add some content in ‘feature1’ as well as add some content in ‘feature2’
